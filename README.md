# Rate My Professor GSU AI üéì

Rate My Professor GSU AI is a web application designed to help students at Georgia State University (GSU) find the best professors for their courses. The application uses advanced AI techniques, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a vector database, to deliver precise and personalized professor recommendations based on user queries.

## Features üí°

- **Professor Recommendations**: The system provides the top 3 professor recommendations based on user queries, considering both ratings and qualitative feedback from student reviews.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can interact with the AI through a chat interface, asking for professor recommendations based on specific criteria.
- **RAG-Based Retrieval**: Utilizes RAG to accurately retrieve and analyze relevant professor data from a comprehensive database.
- **Dynamic Response Generation**: AI generates responses that include professor ratings, subjects taught, and key highlights from reviews.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **Next.js**: Framework for building the web application.
- **OpenAI**: For creating embeddings and generating responses.
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for storing and querying professor data.
- **React**: For building the front-end chat interface.
- **Material-UI**: UI components for a modern and responsive design.

## Usage ‚ö°

1. **Start the Chat**: Begin interacting with the AI by asking for professor recommendations. The AI will guide you through the process.
