          "review": "Professor Weeks has a mixed reputation, with reviews ranging from highly negative to somewhat positive. On the positive side, some students appreciate his open-mindedness and willingness to answer questions. He's described as a professor who is knowledgeable and accessible, and he gives clear examples, especially if you have prior familiarity with the context (e.g., using Zelda for examples). However, the majority of reviews highlight significant challenges in his classes. Many students find his lectures to be disorganized, often filled with irrelevant content that doesn't relate well to the homework or exams. There is frequent criticism about the difficulty of his homework, quizzes, and exams, with some students feeling that they have to learn everything on their own due to the lack of effective instruction. The inconsistency in grading, lack of useful study materials, and the heavy reliance on his personal, outdated site for course content add to the frustrations. Overall, while he might be approachable and knowledgeable, many students struggle with the way he structures and teaches his courses. Unless you're prepared for a challenging and self-directed learning experience, you might want to consider other options."

On one side, students who favor easy grades and less rigorous coursework praise her as the 'best professor,' noting that her exams are straightforward and often pulled directly from study guides, making her classes ideal for a GPA boost. These reviews, however, are suspected to be sarcastic or exaggerated, possibly even generated by bots to inflate her rating. On the other side, many students criticize her teaching style, describing her lectures as unorganized and unengaging, with little actual teaching. They express frustration over her reliance on reading directly from PowerPoint slides, poor communication, and a lack of genuine effort in her teaching. Accusations of using bots to boost her ratings and of grading inconsistencies are frequent, leading many to advise against taking her courses, especially if you're seeking a solid understanding of the material."

          "review": "This professor has a mixed reputation, particularly for her teaching style. In her Operating Systems class (CSC4320), students find the course straightforward if they attend regularly. The tests are online, and collaboration is allowed, which makes it easier to succeed. Additionally, she offers extra points based on class performance, which some students appreciate. However, in other classes, particularly introductory courses like CSC1301 and CSC1302, the reviews are more critical. Students frequently mention that her lectures are heavily reliant on reading from PowerPoint slides, making it difficult to engage with the material. Many students feel that they have to learn most of the content on their own, often turning to external resources like YouTube and Reddit. There are also complaints about her accent making it harder to understand her lectures, and her tendency to not provide clear answers to questions. Some students also express frustration with the lack of interaction and her fast-paced teaching, which leaves them feeling unprepared, especially for subsequent courses. Overall, while her OS class might be more manageable and even beneficial if you attend and collaborate, her introductory classes are often seen as disorganized and lacking effective teaching, leading many students to rely on self-study."
